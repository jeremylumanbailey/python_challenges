# Questions on Eliza or Wilks

# -no conjuntions (don't worry about con conjuntions)

# -simple statments

# -sign up sheet

# -imitate rogerian psychotherapist


# 1) The problem we are trying to solve is that we want to create a program that can imitate a therapist to help
# people talk about their problems in a rogerian manner.

# 2) Run eliza.py using python3. The program will ask for their name to which they can type their
# name or type "My name is Joe"
# after that the program will replay with "How can i help you today?"
# then they can continue typing statements to the program until they are done talking,
# at that point they can type "goodbye" and the
# program will exit.

# 3) The general algorithm used was a while loop that takes input
# and then passes that input to different functions that decide how to respond to the user.
